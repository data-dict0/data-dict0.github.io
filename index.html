          <h3>Flashback: Taal eruption in 2020</h3>
          <br />
          <strong>14 Oct. 2024</strong>
          <p>
            For this week's graphic, we plot the different danger zones
            instituted on January 2020 when the Taal Volcano in Batangas erupted
            for the first time in over a century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The volcano has again shown some restlenessness over the past couple
            of weeks, although the government has kept it under Alert Level 1,
            which indicates that an eruption is not being anticipated soon.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2020, Philippine volcanologists ordered the evacuation of
            residents along 7 kilometers, 14 km and 17 km radius of the Taal
            Volcano, which sits on a lake. The volcano is the Philippines' most
            active and is located around three hours south of Manila, the
            capital. The volcano also sits just beside Tagaytay City, a typical
            summer destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            The danger zones in 2020 are no longer in place these days, although
            the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs)
            has designated the entire island where Taal sits as a permanent
            danger zone.

          <h3>GenSan gets a new district representative, expands House</h3>
          <br />
          <strong>13 Oct. 2024</strong>
          <p>
            General Santos City in South Cotabato is getting its own district
            representative in Congress next year.
          </p>

          <p>
            Originally, General Santos represented the third legislative
            district of South Cotabato province in Mindanao. But under Republic
            Act 11804, GenSan becomes its own congressional district, while
            legislators redrew the rest of the map to keep the number of
            districts in South Cotabato to three.
          </p>

          <p>
            This means South Cotabato will continue to have three congressional
            seats at the House of Representatives, while lawmakers created a new
            seat for General Santos in the next Congress.

          <h3>Filipino athletes</h3>
          <br />
          <strong>2 Oct. 2024</strong>
          <p>
            For this week's graphic, let's talk about sports. There are 1,373
            national athletes competing for the Philippines in 64 sports as of
            August 2024, data from the Philippine Sports Commission showed.
          </p>

          <p>
            National athletes are granted monthly allowances by the government
            depending on their classification. Allowances from P10,000 to
            P45,000 per athlete, according to this
            <a

              >report by SPIN.ph.</a
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            Breaking down the data, the Philippines has 54 national athletes in
            ice hockey, the most in any sport event. Its followed by 49 athletes
            in taekwondo, 48 in athletics, and 44 in baseball, which is a team
            sport.

          <h3>The end of parliamentary courtesy?</h3>
          <br />
          <strong>27 Aug. 2024</strong>
          <p>
            This week's graphic, we look closer at the so-called "parliamentary
            courtesy" extended by Congress to presidents and vice-presidents
            during budget deliberations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Congress extends this courtesy by forgoing lengthy deliberations on
            the budget proposals of the Office of the President and Vice
            President. Media typically report these deliberations to last merely
            minutes. This year however, legislators appeared to have ditched
            this courtesy on the case of Vice President Sara Duterte.
          </p>

          <p>
            On Aug. 27, the House appropriations committee questioned Duterte
            during her office's budget deliberations, which lasted for over five
            hours.

            The police have been searching the compound of the Kingdom of Jesus
            Christ Church in Davao City for days. They were looking for Pastor
            Apollo Quiboloy, the Church's leader, who is wanted by the U.S.
            Federal Bureau of Investigation over sexual abuse of minors charges.

            Government data show the Philippines is having its best performance
            in the Olympics so far in 2024. The country is assured of winning
            four medals, led by two golds from Carlos Yulo in the men's
            gymnastics category. Two other medals, at least bronzes, are
            guaranteed for Nesthy Petecio and Aira Villegas in women's boxing.

            Suddenly, news of Filipinos winning the lotto is aplenty. We looked
            at the data from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO),

          <h3>Marcos generates debt faster than Duterte</h3>
          <br />
          <strong>Jan. 2024</strong>
          <p>
            During his first 18 months in office, Philippine President Ferdinand
            Marcos Jr. has overseen an increase in national government debt
            faster than his previous two predecessors, Rodrigo Duterte and
            Benigno Aquino III, during similar times of their terms. The surge
            past these two presidents may still be temporary - under Duterte,
            for instance, government debt more than doubled after his
            administration went on a

            Our analysis showed that the latest State of the Nation Address
            (SONA) of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. contained 8,227
